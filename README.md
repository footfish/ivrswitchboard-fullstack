# Assignment 2 - IVR switchboard full stack (ReactJS App & API)
Name: Kevin Brennan

## Overview.
This a demonstration implementation of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) switchboard full stack application using React and Node/Express with deployment to Heroku.  

### Features 
-  Simple full stack deployment to Heroku.
-  ReactJS front-end application which utilises react router, bootstrap & JWT authentication. 
-  NodeJS back-end which utilises Express, Mongo db (mongoose), File streaming from Mongo GridFS (testing supertest, mocha).

Note this is a 'wrapper' repository for deployment of the full stack to Heroku.  
Git subtree is used to import the separate [client](/footfish/ivrswitchboard-client) and [server](/footfish/ivrswitchboard-server) repositories.  
This readme focuses on Heroko deployment, follow the links below to read more on client or server.

## Installation requirements & Heroku deployment
The following instructions build the static react client and installs the node express router to serve the api and client. 

### Pre-requisites:
To deploy the full stack you will need to have a [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account and the heroku command line installed. 

### Get the code
Clone this repo locally. Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies

### Mongo Db 
This application requires a mongo database. A free sandbox database is very straightforward to setup on heroku.  
*Note that heroku will require you to authenticate by registering a credit card*

```
heroku addons:create mongolab 
```
This will automatically create the database and set the required heroku environmental variable MONGODB_URI. 

### Environmental variables 
The application requires 3 environmental variables. 
  - MONGODB_URI: 
  - JWT_SECRET: 
  - REACT_APP_SERVER_URI:  
  
 MONGODB_URI is automatically configured, you will need to set the others from the command line. (*tip: `heroku config` lists variables set)
 
- **REACT_APP_SERVER_URI** - heroku host web url.  This is required for the the client build (so client can locate API). 

*heroku info* can be used to find the host web url. The below command should work to set it automatically on any *nix* cli. 

```
heroku config:set REACT_APP_SERVER_URI=$(heroku info -s | grep web_url | cut -d= -f2)
```

- **JWT_SECRET** - secret string used for java web token generation (auth) on server. 

```
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=put-any-secret-here 
```

### Run local 
The following will run the full stack on localhost installed with test data (proxying the api).
You will need to make sure your server .env is correctly configured - [see readme for server](/server).  
(*Note: You may install a local database or use the heroku database configured (MONGODB_URI).*) 

Make sure you are in the codes root folder (ie. folder above ./server and ./client) then run;
```
npm run dev 
```

### Build and deploy 
```
git push heroku 
```
